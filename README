To get started, follow these steps:

1. Place your glTF file and bin file inside the "statics" directory.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of your project.
3. Run the command "npm run start" to start the application.

This will ensure that the glTF and bin files are available for the application to use when it is running.
