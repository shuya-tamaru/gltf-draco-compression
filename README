To get started, follow these steps:

1. Place your glTF file and bin file inside the "statics" directory.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of your project.
3. Install Node.js if you haven't already. You can download it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).
4. After installing Node.js, open a new terminal window to ensure the changes take effect.
5. Navigate to the root of your project in the new terminal window.
6. Run the command "npm install" to install the dependencies.
7. Run the command "npm run start" to start the application.

This will ensure that the glTF and bin files are available for the application to use when it is running.
